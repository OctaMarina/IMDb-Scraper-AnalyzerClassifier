       "\"...and I went into this expecting a Hollywood movie and thrilling entertainment...it delivered.Look, even die-hard F1 fans have to admit that not every waking moment of a race is fun. This film took elements from race history and used it over the space of nine races. Whether it was Grosjean's fireball, or the moment Senna grabbed the fire extinguisher from the marshal, they took and they used. Yes there were some over the top elements, but what would you prefer? Track limit arguments?Go into this expecting a polished action movie with nice nods to F1. I liked it, my kids liked it, and I think if you go in not expecting an Oscar winning movie, or a masterpiece, it is a fine watch.\""

What.. a bad script.. I mean.. how dare they. And the length of the film... my god the length. This is by far the worst movie Ive seen in the last couple of years. Its a waste of your popcorn money kids..\\nThe movie shouldve been called 'How a terrible actor cant hide the fact he's terrible with a terrible script, and somehow win in the most competitive, technical and high-discipline sports in the world by being too cool for school'.If this was a attempt to dumb down f1 for the world (nascar fans...).. well.. they even failed at that.\""
